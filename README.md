# Awesome Literature
A list of the most awesome works of world literature.

## Basic Structure
The basic structure divide the world works by language, and after by region or country.

`<language>/<country-region>/literature.md`

---------------------

I think it's a good way of organize the lists, but any suggestions would be great!

Almost every *awesome* list is obviously about technology stuff, but i've found git and GitHub a nice way to keep public and shareable data about a variety of human knowledge.

I'll need a lot of help and time to build this, but I've started with the brazilian literature.

As a non native english speaker, sorry about typos and grammar, PR as your wish.
